# Null Object Pattern

Replacing conditionals (if obj == null {...} else {...}) with polymorpism.
Replaces a null with a null-object to avoid if statements.
Also can represent a null-behaviour (for instance when collecting a power-up in a game,
 that doesn't allow the player to move for x number of seconds).
