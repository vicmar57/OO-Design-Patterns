# Proxy Pattern

The proxy pattern provides a placeholder for another object to control access to it.  
Useful when the instanciation of an object is expensive/ for caching/ for security.

3 types of proxies:  
1. Remote proxy. Responsible for interaction with an external resource.  
2. Virtual proxy. Controls access to a resource which is expensive to create.  
3. Protection proxy. Controls aceess to a resource based on acecess privilages
